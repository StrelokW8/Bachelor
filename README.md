Metrology Department Management System
Bachelor's Project - VSB

This project aimed to create a system to enhance the workflow within the metrology department of a company. The system focuses on improving the management of calibrations, ethanol inventories, and tracking of machines and tools.

Key Features:
Main Application:
Developed using VCL and FireMonkey, the main program serves as an inventory management tool for machines and tools. It provides an overview of the status, calibration schedules, and other relevant details for each item.

Web Services Server:
A server was developed to facilitate communication between the main application and a mobile app. The mobile app allows metrologists to add and read machine details while on-site in the work plant, ensuring real-time data synchronization.

SQL Database:
The system uses an SQL database to store and manage data, including machine inventories, calibration records, and tool statuses. The database enables efficient querying and management of records.

Technologies Used:
VCL and FireMonkey for the main application
SQL for database management
Web Services for communication between mobile app and main program
Mobile App Integration for on-site data management
This system significantly streamlined metrology department operations by providing an efficient way to plan, track, and manage calibrations, inventory, and equipment data.
